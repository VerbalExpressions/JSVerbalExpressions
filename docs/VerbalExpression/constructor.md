# Constructor

## `constructor`

Construct and return a new instance of [`VerbalExpression`](#verbalexpression). Used to support the `new VerbalExpression()` syntax in ES6 classes as mandated by [the spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor). You usually wouldn't need to call `VerEx().constructor()`.
